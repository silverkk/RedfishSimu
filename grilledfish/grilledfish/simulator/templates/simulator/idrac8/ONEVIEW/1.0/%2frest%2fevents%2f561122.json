These alerts can either be ignored or manually cleared and will normally clear automatically. If the server is booted and running an operating system, the alerts indicate a loss of connectivity between the network adapter and the interconnect.

Verify the configuration of the operating system, as well as the health and link status of the downlink ports on which the connection depends.
